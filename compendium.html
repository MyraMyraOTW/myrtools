				<p class="card-text">The series is set in a fictionalized United States in an alternate history scenario that diverged from our reality in the first half of the 20th century, but the exact date is unknown. The transistor was not invented, while vacuum tubes and atomic physics became the cornerstones to scientific progress, eventually achieving the technological aspirations of the early Atomic Age and locking society into a 1950s cultural stasis. Thus, in this alternative atompunk "golden age", a bizarre socio-technological status quo emerges, in which advanced robots, nuclear-powered cars, directed-energy weapons, and other futuristic technologies are seen alongside 1950s-era computers and telephones. The United States divides itself into 13 commonwealths and the aesthetics and Cold War paranoia of the 1950s continue to dominate the American lifestyle well into the 21st century, leading to America becoming a fascist police state and ultimately abandoning its democratic ideals in favor of a plutocratic system. Political dissidents were sent to prison camps where they were experimented on, and anyone who spoke out against the Enclave-controlled government, be they citizens or occupied Canadians, were executed en masse in the streets.
					<br>
					<br> More than a hundred years before the start of the series, an energy crisis emerged caused by the depletion of petroleum reserves, leading to a period called the "Resource Wars" – a series of events which included a war between the European Commonwealth and the Middle East, the disbanding of the United Nations, the U.S. annexation of Canada, and a Chinese invasion and subsequent military occupation of Alaska coupled with their release of the "New Plague" that devastated the American mainland. These eventually culminated in the "Great War" in the year 2077, a two-hour nuclear exchange on an apocalyptic scale, which subsequently created the post-apocalyptic United States, the setting of the Fallout world.
					<br>
					<br> Fallout draws from 1950s pulp magazine science fiction and superhero comic books, all rooted in Atomic Age optimism of a nuclear-powered future, though gone terribly awry by the time the events of the game take place. The technology is retro-futuristic, with various Raygun Gothic machines such as laser weaponry and boxy Forbidden Planet-style robots. Computers use vacuum tubes instead of transistors, architecture of ruined buildings feature Art Deco and Googie designs, energy weapons resemble those used by Flash Gordon, and what few vehicles remain in the world are all 1950s-styled. Fallout's other production design, such as menu interfaces, are similarly designed to resemble advertisements and toys of the Atomic Age. Advertising in the game such as billboards and brochures has a distinct 1950s motif and feel. The lack of retro-stylization was a common reason for criticism in spin-off games. </p>

							<h4>Human:</h4>
							<br> Humans are the average stock in the wasteland and while not as strong or long lived as super mutants or ghouls they are the majority. They control almost all societies in the wastes and tend to stick around no matter what.
							<br>
							<ul type="square">
								<li>Adaptable: Humans begin with a Free Edge.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h4>Ghoul:</h4>
							<br> They may seem like your typical zombie but most say they don’t like the taste of brains. No one knows how ghouls came to be but many speculate radiation and a lot of “luck” had a hand in it.
							<br>
							<ul type="square">
								<li>Abomination: Ghouls are generally thought to be all feral and are rarely if ever treated with respect. Ghouls gain the Outsider(Major) Hindrance.</li>
								<li>Rotted: Ghouls tend to have necrotic flesh which gives off a rancid stench and this is never pleasant to be around. Ghouls gain the Ugly(Minor) Hindrance.</li>
								<li>Atomic!: Ghouls can survive in radioactive areas for long amounts of time and even get healed by it. Their rad resistance is 6 and radiation levels act as positives to Natural Healing rolls. In radioactive areas ghouls receive +1 to toughness. However, when exposed to level 4 radiation for a long period, they randomly gain the Glowing One Hindrance or go Feral. Whilst Feral Ghouls are not dead, they no longer have a mind of their own and are subject to control by the GM.</li>
								<li>Mutated Metabolism: Ghouls make natural healing checks every two days instead of five, and do not require food or water. In addition, Ghouls must make Vigour rolls for a Chem to have any effect.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h4>Super Mutants:</h4>
							<br>
							<h5>First Gen:</h5>
							<br> The GEN 1 super mutants were those created by the Master. While these variants retained most of their intelligence or even gained higher intelligence they were rare due to radiation free humans being required to make them. While they were less powerful than other variants they excelled at controlling other super mutants.
							<ul type="square">
								<li>Stronk!: Super Mutants start with d6 Strength and may increase it to d12+1 by normal advancement.</li>
								<li>Cellular Reconstruction: Radiation Immunity, cannot die of old age.</li>
								<li>G.O.A.T Professional: GEN 1 super mutants managed to keep their intelligence but they lost their old lives. Start with d6 smarts and may increase it to d12+1 with normal advancement.</li>
								<li>Size +2: armour doesn’t fit unless custom tailored and toughness +1.</li>
								<li>Meaty Figure: All Thumbs (small items) and Ugly</li>
								<li>Outsider (Major): Super mutants are typically shot on sight without a very compelling reason not to fire.</li>
							</ul>
							<br>
							<h5>Second Gen:</h5>
							<br> GEN 2 super mutants were those created without the aid of the Master and tended to be stupid. While they may have been stupid they possessed incredible strength.
							<ul type="square">
								<li>Stronk!: GEN 2 super mutants start with d8 strength and may increase it to d12+2 by normal advancement.</li>
								<li>Cellular Reconstruction: Radiation Immunity, cannot die of old age.</li>
								<li>Simple Minded: The mind of a super mutant is all but destroyed by the process that transforms them. They have a –2 penalty on all Smarts rolls they make, and cannot increase their Smarts above a d8. Most super mutants have only fragments of memory from before they were changed.</li>
								<li>Size +2: armour doesn’t fit unless custom tailored and toughness +1.</li>
								<li>Grunt: Super Mutants are bred to take orders; if trying to act on its own free will (or otherwise oppose orders), they suffer a –4 to all Trait rolls.</li>
								<li>Meaty Figure: All Thumbs (small items) and Ugly</li>
								<li>Outsider (Major): Super mutants are typically shot on sight without a very compelling reason not to fire.</li>

							<h5>Anti-Survivalist (Major):</h5> You’ve grown up under a rock for your entire life and your knowledge of the outside world is minimal at best -2 to survival, tracking and streetwise.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Raider (Major):</h5> You made a name for yourself and are disliked by a lot of groups of the wasteland. Gain the Bloodthirsty hindrance and normal people start at uncooperative towards you.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Combat Shock (Minor):</h5> Some people freeze up when things get dangerous, and you are one of them. It could be due to fear, flashbacks, or something else; whatever the reason, when action cards are dealt in the first round of any combat, you must make a Spirit roll or start the combat Shaken.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>RADICAL! (Minor):</h5> “I take radiation by its metaphorical horns “, is what you use to explain your strange obsession. Anytime you come across something radioactive you must attempt to pour it on yourself to test the effects. Start with a damaged radiation suit (+1 rad resist instead of +3). Your PC also believes the effects of radiation poisoning are caused by food poisoning.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Addict (Minor):</h5> Drugs are what you live for you’re not sure when you started but whenever drugs are around you must make a spirit roll at -2 to resist taking them immediately.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Chem Resistant (Minor):</h5> Due to a crazy mutation, your body resists all forms of drugs and medical stimulants make a vigour roll at -2 to achieve an effect.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Schizophrenia (Major):</h5> The character has a serious and negative mental illness. Players may choose or roll an alternate identity and a trigger from the provided tables. This illness also gives a -2 to charisma from anyone who notices.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Glowing One (Major Ghoul Only):</h5> Exposure to massive amounts of radiation have made you glow! While this may seem awesome it has caused your brain to fry a bit. -1 die type smarts, PC does not gain lighting penalties in melee combat, -4 stealth penalty, PC’s nearby take low level radiation exposure per day, gain the Rad Resistance edge, and the PC can make a spirit roll once per day at -4 to call feral ghouls to his/her aid (not the parties aid).
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Falling Feral (Major Ghoul Only):</h5> It's not clearly understood why most ghouls eventually degrade into feral ghouls. But you know it's starting to happen to you, and soon. You cannot raise your Smarts die through advancement. Each month of game time, draw a card. If you draw a club, your Smarts decreases by one die type permanently. When (not if) your Smarts decreases to below 1d4, you permanently become a feral ghoul and completely lose yourself. There is no known way to reverse this process once it's begun.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Grunt (Major Super Mutant):</h5> The player is extremely suited for following orders and seems to possess only rudimentary intelligence. The player may not increase smarts past d4 and must follow all orders given to them from their master. If they lose their master, they must seek out a suitable replacement. The character must also make a Smarts check to avoid being fooled into doing actions possibly detrimental to them unless the action will obviously kill them.</p>

								Your character starts out with 500 caps and the clothes on their back. Use the tables below to buy some starting gear.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h5>Melee Weapons:</h5> The iconic weapons of psychotic bandits tend to be the cheapest and easiest to obtain.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h5>Projectile Weapons:</h5> Ballistic Firearms are the most prevalent form of long range deathdealing in the wastes. While higher calibre ammunition may be rare, weapons can be retooled to accept other calibres.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h6>Retooling:</h6> Retooling a weapon for different ammunition types cost ½ the listed weapon price, ½ their weight in scrap, and 2d6 hours with a sufficient workshop.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h6>Magazines:</h6> Guns require magazines and must be purchased* to use the gun w/o having to chamber every shot. Magazines cost 1/10 the guns listed price and come empty. You may reload magazines for your weapons while not in combat or in 1d4 minutes. Empty Magazines weigh 1 lb.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h6>Mounted:</h6> Mounted weapons require the user to take 1d4 turns setting up their mounting hardware to be fired. They cannot be hip fired unless you are wearing power armour.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h6>Grenade Launchers:</h6> Grenade launchers while deadly have a safety feature. 40mm grenades must fly at least 20ft to prime to explode. If an enemy is hit within 20ft they take 2d4 bludgeoning damage. * Weapons with no mag ENC have internal magazines or projectile ammunition
								<br>
								<br>
								<h6>Energy Weapons:</h6> Energy Weapons are the bright flash death machines of the wastes. They turn your foes to ash and green goo with cheap plentiful ammunition. Energy weapons are very advanced however and net a user with -4 to their combat repair rolls. Energy Weapons deal normal damage to power armour.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h5>Explosives:</h5> Need to turn a room of enemies into fine mist? Invest in explosives! However, stock up in the repair skill as to setup landmines you must roll. Landmines: To setup a landmine make a repair roll, a Success the landmine is armed and you have 10 seconds to move away, on a Failure you think its armed but it is not, on a Critical Failure the landmine explodes immediately.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h6>C4:</h6> C4 is a special explosive that a character may spend 30 seconds shaping onto a surface. This allows locks to be precision detonated and doors to be bypassed. If you plan on doing this make your plans clear to the DM. The shaped charge consumes the C4 and projects the explosion with the Cone template in the direction the player specified on setup.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h5>Heavy Weapons:</h5> Heavy weapons are the bane of all men. Meeting an enemy with a Fat Man means certain doom for anyone. Heavy weapons ½ the effective armour of anything without Heavy Armour.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h5>Ammunition:</h5> Ammunition listed can be modified on purchase as follows:
								<ul style="square">
									<li>Surplus: Surplus ammunition is 50% the price of regular ammo but makes guns fail on shooting rolls 3 and under.</li>
									<li>Armour Piercing: Give your weapon the ability to punch through steel. 25% mark-up on price and AP +1.</li>
									<li>Incendiary: Want to give your bullets a burning sensation. 50% mark-up on price and Burning Weapon modifier for bullets.
									</li>
									<li>Explosive: Give your bullets a bang for your buck. 200% markup on price and deals halfbullet damage in Small Burst template.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Armour:</h5> If you want to specifically armour your character split the price of the armour as follows, 1/6 for each arm and leg and the chest is 2/6 the price. Armour values follow the traditional melee/firearm.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h6>Power Armour:</h6> Power Armour makes you a walking tank for a high price. Weapons that are not Heavy Weapons must make it through double your armour. Heavy Weapons half your armour value and energy weapons encounter the listed value. Carry weight is doubled as well, and when wearing the power armour, it weighs nothing.
								<br>
								<br>
								<h6>Kevlar Vests:</h6> The most versatile torso armour in the wastes. While generally rare from military sources, pre-war police had a decent amount stocked. This armour can have a set of plates placed inside of it, effectively increasing the armour value.</p>

							All weapons have a rating; a highcondition weapon will function more like a weapon in its prime, but will also be much more valuable and much more difficult to find.
							<br>
							<br> When a critical failure is rolled on the Shooting or Fighting roll, or if the weapon is exposed to particularly bad conditions (submerged in mud, for example), the quality of the weapon is reduced. Weapon condition can be restored with a successful Repair roll, proper parts and tools, and enough time. The ratings consist of Poor, Worn, Mediocre, and High. Highquality weapons use the statistics listed in the Gear section. For every step below that, roll on the weapon condition table below. If a weapons quality drops below Poor, it is no longer usable.

							The price is also modified by the quality: High-quality items cost double the listed price; Worn costs 75% while Poor quality costs 50% (rounded up). Weapons below Poor typically cost 25% of the listed price.
							<br>
							<br> Parts from gear can be utilized in repairing a similar item, but the quality can impose penalties on the Repair roll: Mediocre parts impose a –1, while Poor parts impose a –2 (these do not stack; use the lowest penalty for the roll). Parts from unusable weapons apply a –4 penalty to Repair rolls.

							Cybernetics allow even the weakest person to become a powerful athlete. When installing these bionic suites, a skilled doctor is required. Cybernetic components are rarely invisible from observers. To make a cybernetic part invisible to all but direct searches it costs an additional 50%. Cybernetics have the following statistics.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Strain:</strong> The stress the cybernetics place on the character’s body. Characters suffer fatigue if they exceed their maximum strain.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Cost:</strong> The price of the cybernetic and it’s cost of installation. Be warned, when using cybernetics, they can be disabled for 1d4 hours with pulse weapons on a raise.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Installation/Removal:</h5> The cost per bionic part includes installation. Visiting an unskilled doctor reduces the cost 25% but the character must make a Vigour roll at -4. If succeeded, the implant is fine, if failed the implant is rejected with or without a refund.
							<br>
							<br> Removal costs 25% of the implant’s cost but may be free from unskilled doctors if they get to keep the implant. Removal from unskilled doctors makes the character roll Vigour at -2 or be Exhausted from the botched surgery for two weeks.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Limbs:</strong> If a cybernetic part was meant to replace a limb and didn’t take, the character is without the limb. Prosthetics cost 1200c and characters suffer a -1 to all rolls with the prosthetic.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>Strain:</h5> Cybernetics are invasive and replace bone, tissue and place electrical and biological strain on the character.
							<br>
							<br> Every cybernetic enhancement has a Strain rating. The amount of cybernetics a character can place in their body is equal to half their Vigour or Spirit die, whichever is lower. This is called <strong>Maximum Strain.</strong>
							<br>
							<br> Once a user reaches their Maximum Strain they cannot handle any more stress to their body.
							<br>
							<br> If additional strain is incurred the user suffers a level of constant Fatigue equal to the amount exceeded. No character can exceed their Max Strain by more than two points.</p>

							Robot companions can be a big help in the wasteland and can be used as mobile gun platforms, mules, and mobile shields. Robots like all machines require maintenance to function at peak performance.
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Power:</strong> Robots run off Microfusion Cells and run for a week. After a week, the cells must be replaced or the robot becomes inactive. The number of cells needed is equal to the amount of mods / 2 (rounded up).
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Maintenance:</strong> Each month of use, the owner must pay 1% of the robots base cost in maintenance. If the maintenance isn’t paid, the player must roll on the Glitch Table.
